                <b>How to Teach Quantum Physics to Your Dog</b><br><br>
                Emmy is no ordinary dog. When adopted from the shelter by physics professor Chad Orzel, she becomes immediately fascinated by his work.
                Could she use quantum tunnelling to get through the neighbour’s fence? How about diffracting round a tree to chase squirrels?
                Or using virtual particles to catch bunnies made of cheese? <br>
                Taking Emmy’s anarchic behaviour as a starting point, Orzel explains the key theories of quantum physics.
                From quarks and gluons to Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, this is a uniquely entertaining way to unlock the secrets of the universe.

                <b>The Hobbit</b><br><br>
                Bilbo Baggins is a hobbit who enjoys a comfortable, unambitious life, rarely travelling further than the pantry of his hobbit-hole in Bag End.<br>
                But his contentment is disturbed when the wizard, Gandalf, and a company of thirteen dwarves arrive on his doorstep
                one day to whisk him away on an unexpected journey `there and back again'.<br>
                They have a plot to raid the treasure hoard of Smaug the Magnificent, a large and very dangerous dragon...

                <b>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</b><br><br>
                ‘A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and authoritative tap.’<br>
                Set against the foggy backdrop of London and the English countryside, each story in this quintessential collection unravels an exciting new mystery,
                from mistaken identity and portentous omens to counterfeit currency and jewellery theft.
                They follow the famous detective and his partner Watson on the trail of some of their most enjoyable cases
